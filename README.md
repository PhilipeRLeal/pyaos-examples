About this package
------------------

The git repository pyaos-examples provides example scripts for
accomplishing atmospheric and oceanic sciences (AOS) tasks in Python.
There are many great examples of AOS Python available on the Internet at
various package sites (e.g., CDAT, PyNGL, etc.), but few examples that
show the integration of different technologies, or that address tasks
that do not neatly fit into the common tasks associated with a single,
released package.  This repository aims to provide just those examples
that are not covered elsewhere.

Thus, the scripts in this repository are, in general, unrelated to
one another; this is not a coherent package of code like matplotlib,
scipy, etc.  Still, these scripts provide useful examples for researchers
and students looking for ways to accomplish atmospheric and oceanic
sciences tasks.
