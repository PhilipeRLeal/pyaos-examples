README FILE


The git repository pyaos-examples provides example scripts for
accomplishing atmospheric and oceanic sciences tasks in Python.  The
scripts in this repository are, in general, unrelated to one another;
this is not a coherent package of code like matplotlib, scipy, etc.
Still, these scripts provide useful examples for researchers and students
looking for ways to accomplish atmospheric and oceanic sciences tasks.
